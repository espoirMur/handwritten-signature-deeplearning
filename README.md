# handwritten-signature-deep learning
Contains random ideas for a deep learning project about signature handwritten recognition

I had the ideas to start this project as a learning project for deep learning!

Will apply the method of deep learning to recognize signatures on a document.

But for now I still looking how to start:

the first step is to collect useful resources and check what is already done by others peoples.
here is what I have collected.

- [The first one ](https://www.google.rw/amp/s/gizmeon.com/2017/10/21/fraud-analysis-deep-learning-n-offline-signature-verification/amp/)
- [the second](https://github.com/luizgh/sigver_wiwd/blob/master/interactive_example.ipynb) a jupyter notebook with some work done.
- [the third one](http://aeop.asecamps.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/5.pdf)

Let me digest them and plan how this project will bde done.
